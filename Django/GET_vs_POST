1. when we are sending request from client to server that 
   time we use Request Method. So by default the method "GET".
2. In Request Method many methods there:
		a. GET
		b. POST
		c. PUT
		d. DELETE
		e. HEAD
		f. CONNECT
		g. OPTION
		h. TRACE
		i. PATCH
3. GET:
		when we send Request in HTTP protocol from client to 
		server that time we use "GET" method EX. hey i want image
		
4. POST:
		when we submit some data from client to server for ex:
        we fill a form and submit is called post
		
when we use GET that time in the URL value also will be present 
but in case of POST that value will be not present. only function name 
will be present
